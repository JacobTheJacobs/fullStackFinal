                <h2>why?</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind Astronerds is to make it easy for people to
                    explore and learn about the field of astrophotography also
                    know as astronomical imaging, which is photography of
                    astronomical objects, celestial events, and areas of the
                    night sky. We do that by giving our visitors the opportunity
                    to get mesmerized by a variety of breath taking night sky
                    photos taken by fellow astronerds, and helping other
                    professionals sell their mind-blowing art pieces with zero
                    commission.
                </p>
                <h2>a little history</h2>
                <p>
                    The development of astrophotography as a scientific tool was
                    pioneered in the mid-19th century for the most part by
                    experimenters and amateur astronomers, or so-called
                    "gentleman scientists" (although, as in other scientific
                    fields, these were not always men). Because of the very long
                    exposures needed to capture relatively faint astronomical
                    objects, many technological problems had to be overcome.
                    These included making telescopes rigid enough so they would
                    not sag out of focus during the exposure, building clock
                    drives that could rotate the telescope mount at a constant
                    rate, and developing ways to accurately keep a telescope
                    aimed at a fixed point over a long period of time. Early
                    photographic processes also had limitations. The
                    daguerreotype process was far too slow to record anything
                    but the brightest objects, and the wet plate collodion
                    process limited exposures to the time the plate could stay
                    wet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first known attempt at astronomical photography was by
                    Louis Jacques Mand√© Daguerre, inventor of the daguerreotype
                    process which bears his name, who attempted in 1839 to
                    photograph the Moon. Tracking errors in guiding the
                    telescope during the long exposure meant the photograph came
                    out as an indistinct fuzzy spot. John William Draper, New
                    York University Professor of Chemistry, physician and
                    scientific experimenter managed to make the first successful
                    photograph of the moon a year later on March 23, 1840,
                    taking a 20-minute-long daguerreotype image using a 5-inch
                    (13 cm) reflecting telescope.
